- *语气*:
  - **陈述语气**: 陈述事实
  - **祈使语气**: 用于表达命令或请求
  - **虚拟语气**: 用于表达说话人的主观愿望或假设，这些愿望或假设不一定是事实，或与事实相反。虚拟语气是通过改变谓语动词形式来体现的。

## 一,if引导的非真实条件句

##### 1. If I were a boy, I would be a better man.
##### 2. If she had arrived last night, she would have gone to the party.
##### 3. If you came tomorrow, I would give you a big surprise.

### 1.动词形式
| 时间   | if从句       | 主句                                      |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| 现在   | did/were     | would/should/could/might + do      |
| 过去   | had done     | would/should/could/might + have done   |
| 过去   | did/were,were to do,should do     | would/should/could/might + do  |     

##### 1. If there ==were== no plants, we would have no animals and meat.
##### 2. It ==would be== very nice if  it were possible.
##### 3. If you ==had come== five minutes earlier, you would have met the famous star.
##### 4. I ==would go== to the party with you if I didn't need to attend the meeting.
##### 5. If he had followed my advice, he ==would be== better now.


### 2.混合时间虚拟（错综时间）
#### 当从句和主句动作发生时间不一致，则主从句分别采用对应的动词形式。(注意时间词)

##### If you didn't watch the movie last night, you wouldn't be so sleepy.

### 3.虚拟倒装
#### 在if引导的非真实条件句中，可以把were/had(助动词)/should提到主语之前，同时省略if。
#### ==解题技巧:把句子还原.==

#####   If I were a boy, I would be a better man.Were I a boy, I would be a better man.
#####  ->Were I a boy, I would be a better man.Were I a boy, I would be a better man.
#####  If Bob had known the truth, he wouldn't have helped her at all.

### 4.含蓄虚拟

#### without,but for,otherwise,or替代if引导的从句,主句动词形势同if

##### Without plants wew would have no animals and meat

##### But for your help ,we couldn't have finished the task as promised

## 二, ==(should)== do 形式虚拟形式

##### My mon required that them room (should) be cleaned every day

### 1. 当主句中含有命令、建议、请求/要求、决定等含义的词（区分词性），所接从句谓语动词用 (should) do/be done。

##### 命令: order,command 

#### 建议: suggest, advise, propose, recommend

#### 请求/要求: demand, require, request, insist, desire, ask, prefer

#### 决定: decide, determine 

#### My suggestion is that you should learn from the very start

#### It is suggestion that the meeting should be delayed to next Friday

### 2.在It is +adj/done/n.+that +从句，从句谓语动词也可以用(should) do/be done形式

##### 关键词
#### ==important,vital,crucial,necessary,essential,urgent,natural,strange,pity,shame==

#### It is essential that you should have some work experience
### It is a pity that should lose the game

### 3. 在  in case 、 lest 、 for fear that （以防，以免）引导的从句中，动词形式通常使用 (should) do 或 be done。

- **在情况下 (in case)**:
  - 句子: Take an umbrella with you in case it (should) rain.

- **以免 (lest)**:
  - 句子: I didn't make any noise lest I (should) disturb you.

- **以防 (for fear that)**:
  - 句子: I didn't make any noise for fear that I (should) disturb you.

## 三,特殊虚拟
### 1.固定句型:It is (about/high) time (that)+主语+did.....“该是做...的时候了”
#### 1. It is high time that we took measures to protect the environment.
#### 2. It is time we bought a new computer.

### 2.  wish,   if only  (要是...就好了),  as if,   as though  (好像),  would rather,   would sooner  (宁愿) 等引导的从句通常使用虚拟语气。

| 时间   | 好像,要是 + 从句  | 宁愿 + 从句 |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 现在   | did/were                  | did/were     |
| 过去   | had done                  | had done     |
| 将来   | would/could do            | did/were     |

#### 1.I'd rather you went tomorrow.
#### 2.I wish I had studied harder three years ago.
#### 3.I wish that someday I will live on the moon.
#### 4.If only I had taken his advice, I wouldn't have made such a mistake.
#### 5.He looks as if he knows me very much.

### 3.情态动词的虚拟语气情态动词(过去式)+have done“本...(实际没有)
#### should have done=ought to have done 本应该做某事(却没有)
#### could have done 本来能够做某事(却没有)
#### might have done 本来可能做某事(却没有)
#### would have done 本来要做某事(却没有)
#### needn't have done 本不需要做某事(却做了)
#### ==注意:must have done表对过去的推测“─定/肯定...了”==
